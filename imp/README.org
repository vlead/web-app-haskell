#+TITLE: web-app-haskell

An user directory web app written in Haskell.


* Introduction

This application is an implementation of a set of requirements for an =User
Directory Web App=. The app stores a set of =Users= and their details, and
allows us to perform CRUD operations.

* Frameworks and Libraries Used

Frameworks used are :

  - ~Servant~ : a web framework that allows us to define APIs at the
    type-level. It also acts as a wrapper over Haskell's low-level =WAI= (Web
    Application Interface) library.
  - ~Servant-Client~ : Used to derive client functions for the API routes.
  - ~Yesod-Persistent~ : a type-safe multi-database API, used to interact with
    the underlying ~sqlite~ database.
  - ~Hspec~ : a test suite library for Haskell.
