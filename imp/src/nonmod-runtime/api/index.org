The =Api= package contains the definitions for the routes that form the REST
interface for the application.

The package contains the following components:

  - [[file:NonSecureRoutes.org][NonSecureApi]] : routes that can be accessed by all users

  - [[file:NonAdminApi.org][NonAdminApi]] : routes that can only be accessed by logged-in users

  - [[file:AdminApi.org][AdminApi]] : routes that can only be accessed by users logged-in with role =Admin=

  - [[file:Api.org][Api]] : consolidation of all the above routes
