#+TITLE: Notes 


* Frameworks and Libraries Used

Frameworks used are :

  - ~Servant~ : a web framework that allows us to define APIs at the
    type-level. It also acts as a wrapper over Haskell's low-level =WAI= (Web
    Application Interface) library.
  - ~Servant-Client~ : Used to derive client functions for the API routes.
  - ~Yesod-Persistent~ : a type-safe multi-database API, used to interact with
    the underlying ~sqlite~ database.
  - ~Hspec~ : a test suite library for Haskell.
* Database Actions

Database actions are IO actions, and return a value of type =IO (Maybe a)=.
