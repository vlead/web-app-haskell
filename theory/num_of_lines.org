* Number of Words

** Number of words- Haskell

Measured in words.

*** Total: 1,205 lines of code
*** Total: 13,589 words

** Number of words- Python: 61511
* Type-Safety

The python program employs predicate checks to ensure that input/output data,
as well as data passed within the program, is correctly formed.

Haskell abstracts out the notion of predicate checks via the type system.
* Documentation

Haskell libraries are poorly documented compared to Python's.
* Checks that are not abstracted by types

Checks on data that are of the same type (for eg: checking that user input to
function is not the same as logged-in user) are not abstracted away by the type
system in Haskell.
